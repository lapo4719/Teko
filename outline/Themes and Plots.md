# Goals of Writing
- I want every character to die and for that to be a happy ending in many different ways and views. The happiness of the deaths at the ending will be the fruition of each of the ways people can live.
- The "meaning of life" theme, which is the say, the philosophical theme of exploring how people will live, will be best understood in the ending through the effects on others -- This is a goal of the writing: the meaning of life cannot be understood through the person living it. It must be understood through it's affects on others and viewed by others to truly appreciate and to even correctly understand what one's meaning was.
	- It Could? Will be? A misunderstanding throughout the work is that people can create their meaning all by themselves and hang on to it while they live and become consistently happy through it.
- I want everyone to live a different philosophy of life and to find their form of meaning in their life In a futured pre-apocalyptic world. The story has mixed elements of village-core, technocracy, engineering, humanity's relationship with its most vulnerable, and its relationship  with the resources of the natural world. The story is focused on a village town in Michigan in the year 2060 that becomes the site of a research center developing a new form of fusion energy.

# The First Promises & Endings
